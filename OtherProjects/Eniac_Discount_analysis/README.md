## About:
This project is part of the common tasks of monthly (quarterly) sales analysis - Discount Analysis.

In general, we have some information about sales (in our example, the initial data sets are not in good enough condition, but we have what we have), and our task is to understand how close our discount policy is to the sales results. Or, in other words, how our discount policy affects (stimulates) our sales.

To understand how one of these things depends on the other one, I will use the correlation coefficient. If this coeff. is close to 0, the dependencies are absent. Otherwise (is close to 1 or -1), the dependencies are strong. Negative coeff. means inverse dependence.
