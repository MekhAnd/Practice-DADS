## Legend:

Eniac, the company we represent, is considering the possibility of cooperation with Magist (located in Brazil) in order to expand its sphere of influence.

Eniac has a dataset provided by Magist containing information on Magist's operations over a 24-month period.

The analytics team's task is to determine:
* Eniac's catalogue consists entirely of tech products and is heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
* Among Eniac's efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist's deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?

The team also received the following data about the company:
* Revenue EUR 14 million
* Average order price EUR 710
* Average monthly revenue EUR 1.17 million
* Average item price EUR 540
